Introduction
1. Severity of problem?
- mortality
- stroke
2. What is not known?
- no treatment guideline
- current rx paradigm is ....
- machine learning models, -> can they be used to identify who will have thrombus resolution
3. What we want to do?
- machine learning model to predict thrombus resolution

Methods
- how data was obtained -> aloysius paper
- ethics -> aloysius paper
- statistics 

Results

Describe population
1. Table 1 - demographics - top 10 variables
2. Table 2 - model selection
3. AUROC plots
What are the top few predictors
Supplementary data for remaining variables


Discussion
1. Summary of paper: we found that using xx model... we can accurate predict ....
2. Explain findings - based on top 3 variables
3. Compare and contrast with other studies which have tried to predict thrombus resolution. Which variables stood out, underlying pathophysiology
4. What to do: can be implemented into EMR, CDSS, Point of care, customise anticoagulation duration; could suggest a more personalised approach.
5. Other use of machine learning models for other cardiac events -> has proven to be useful
6. Strengths and limitations:
- to the best of our knowledge, this is the first... study
- robust methodology...
- however, limited by small sample size - but LVT is rare
- black box
- requires external validation in other population

Conclusion: 
- In summary, this xx model has shown to predict LVT resolution with ... accuracy with a AUC . This suggests that the use of machine learning might be a useful adjunct in helping to predict LVT resolution and can provide clinicians with a useful aid. Further clinical studies are needed.
